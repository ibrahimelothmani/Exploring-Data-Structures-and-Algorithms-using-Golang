Data structures are one of the more vital topics to be covered in the Computer Science 
curriculum. A good data structure used for a problem can make or break the solution 
and understanding the benefits and disadvantages of a data structure can allow us 
to choose the data structure that is most suitable for the problem we are facing.
 
Although it is true that most developers will not deal with data structures on a 
day-to-day basis (a lot of work for developers tends toward API integration work); 
however, these data structures underpin and power the various libraries we use 
without much thought. We are benefiting from its use even if we do not deal with it 
on a daily basis.
we will learn more about the various common Data Structures and their possible use cases.

Structure
we will discuss the following topics:
 • Singly linked list
 • Doubly linked list
 • Circular linked list
 • Stack
 • Queue
 • Binary Tree
 • Hashing

Objectives
We will cover the building of various data structures such as linked lists, stacks, 
queues, binary trees, and hashed maps (hashing). For each of the data structures 
mentioned here, we will attempt to cover various scenarios (where applicable), such 
as listing what is in the structure and determining the length of items within the 
structure. Other scenarios that can also be explored will be the cases where items are 
inserted into the data structure. Cases where items are removed from the structure 
as well as cases where one is attempting to search for a specific item within the items 
in the structure.
