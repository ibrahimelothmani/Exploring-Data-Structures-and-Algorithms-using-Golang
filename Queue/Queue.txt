The queue data structure is another of those important data structures that will 
definitely be used pretty heavily in the industry. Some of the examples will be the 
various queueing systems that manage thousands of messages to do asynchronous 
processing of the messages into useful output. The queue data structure also has its 
own mantra as well “First in, First out”—essentially, like how you would expect of 
a queue in real life. If you had queued up for anything before, you would roughly 
understand how this data structure operates as it does so in a similar fashion.
