# Data Structures and Algorithms Implementation

This repository contains implementations of various fundamental data structures and algorithms in Go. It serves as a learning resource for understanding the core concepts of computer science and their practical applications.

## Overview

While many developers may not directly work with data structures daily, these fundamental concepts power the libraries and tools we use regularly. Understanding data structures helps in choosing the right tool for specific problems and optimizing solutions.

## Contents

### Data Structures
- **Linked Lists**
  - Singly Linked List
  - Doubly Linked List
  - Circular Linked List
- **Stack**
- **Queue**
- **Binary Tree**
- **Hashed Maps**

### Algorithms
- **Sorting**
  - Bubble Sort
  - Merge Sort
  - Quick Sort
- **Searching**
  - Binary Search

### Additional Topics
- **Dynamic Programming**

## Implementation Details

All implementations are written in Go (Golang), providing clear and practical examples of each data structure and algorithm. Each implementation includes:
- Basic structure implementation
- Common operations (insertion, deletion, search)
- Traversal methods (where applicable)
- Usage examples

## Learning Objectives

This repository aims to help learners:
1. Understand the fundamental concepts of each data structure
2. Learn when to use specific data structures for different scenarios
3. Practice implementing common operations on various data structures
4. Analyze the efficiency and trade-offs of different implementations

## Usage

Each directory contains a standalone implementation with its own 'main.go' file. To run any example:

\`\`\`bash
cd "path/to/specific/implementation"
go run main.go
\`\`\`
